# discord-sticker-scraper

## Steps to run:

1. run `scrape.py` and change the `channel_id` variable accordingly
2. for each run with a different channel, copy and past what is in `discord.log` into `total_log.txt`
3. when you are done with your channels and have removed everything except the https responses, now run `log.py` (make sure you delete everything inside `logs/`
4. then run `generate_data.py`

see, very easy
